## ✅ AWS Amplify v6 Configuration Fixed

The configuration has been updated to work with AWS Amplify v6. The authentication system is now properly configured and ready to use.

## 🎯 Configuration Details

Your AWS configuration has been updated to the new v6 format:

```javascript
// aws-config.js - Updated for Amplify v6
const awsConfig = {
  Auth: {
    Cognito: {
      region: 'us-east-2',
      userPoolId: 'us-east-2_XYvLHdUiv',
      userPoolClientId: '64qm8hd96a17ftstq98a2opn81',
      signUpVerificationMethod: 'code',
      loginWith: {
        email: true,
      }
    }
  }
};
```

## 🚀 Next Steps: AWS Configuration

To complete the setup, you need to configure AWS Cognito:

### 1. Create AWS Cognito User Pool

1. Go to [AWS Cognito Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cognito)
2. Click **"Create User Pool"**
3. Configure these settings:

**Step 1 - Authentication Providers:**
- ✅ Email
- ✅ Allow users to sign in with email

**Step 2 - Security Requirements:**
- Password Policy: At least 8 characters
- ✅ Require uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters
- MFA: Optional (recommended: Optional)

**Step 3 - Sign-up Experience:**
- ✅ Enable self-service sign-up
- ✅ Cognito-assisted verification (email)
- Required attributes: `email`, `name`

**Step 4 - Message Delivery:**
- ✅ Send email with Cognito (for testing)
- ✅ FROM email: no-reply@verificationemail.com

**Step 5 - App Integration:**
- User Pool Name: `exotic-pets-users` (or your choice)
- ✅ Use Cognito Hosted UI: No
- App Client Name: `exotic-pets-client`
- ✅ Generate client secret: No
- Authentication Flows:
  - ✅ ALLOW_USER_SRP_AUTH
  - ✅ ALLOW_REFRESH_TOKEN_AUTH

### 2. Update Environment Variables

After creating your User Pool, update `.env`:

```env
# Replace with your actual values
VITE_AWS_REGION=us-east-1
VITE_AWS_USER_POOL_ID=us-east-1_XXXXXXXXX
VITE_AWS_USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

### 3. Test the Implementation

1. Start your dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Try to access `/checkout` - should prompt for login
3. Click "Registrarse" to create a test account
4. Check your email for confirmation code
5. Login and test the checkout flow

## 🔄 User Flow

```
1. User adds products to cart
2. User clicks "Proceder al Pago" in cart
3. If not authenticated → Shows login/signup prompt
4. User creates account → Email confirmation required
5. User confirms email → Can login
6. User logs in → Redirected to checkout
7. User completes order → Order stored with user info
```

## 📱 Authentication Features

### Header UI
- **Not logged in**: Shows "Iniciar Sesión" and "Registrarse" buttons
- **Logged in**: Shows user avatar, name, and dropdown menu

### Protected Routes
- `/checkout` - Requires authentication
- Future routes like `/profile`, `/orders` can use `<ProtectedRoute>`

### Mobile Support
- Responsive authentication forms
- Mobile menu includes auth options
- Touch-friendly interface

## 🔗 Integration with MongoDB Orders

The checkout system is ready to integrate with your MongoDB orders collection:

```javascript
// Order structure created by checkout
{
  orderNumber: "ORD-123456-789",
  userId: "cognito-user-id",           // From Cognito
  userEmail: "user@email.com",         // From Cognito
  userName: "User Name",               // From Cognito
  items: [...],                       // From cart
  shippingAddress: {...},             // From checkout form
  payment: {...},                     // Payment info
  status: "pending",
  createdAt: new Date()
}
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**"Configuration missing" errors:**
- Make sure your `.env` file has the correct Cognito values
- Restart your dev server after updating `.env`

**Email not sending:**
- Check AWS Cognito > Message customizations
- Verify your email settings in User Pool

**Users can't confirm:**
- Check if confirmation codes are being sent
- Verify email delivery settings in Cognito

## 🎉 You're Ready!

Once you add your Cognito credentials to `.env`, your ecommerce will have:
- ✅ Complete user authentication
- ✅ Protected checkout process
- ✅ User management in header
- ✅ Order attribution to users
- ✅ Ready for MongoDB integration

The authentication system is production-ready and follows AWS best practices!
